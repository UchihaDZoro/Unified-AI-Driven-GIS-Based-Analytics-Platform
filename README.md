# 🌍 Unified AI-Driven GIS Analytics Platform

A unified **AI-powered Geographic Information System (GIS) platform** that enables **analysis, tracking, and visualization** of urban and environmental data.
It combines **interactive mapping**, **deep learning–based segmentation**, and **RAG-powered contextual insights** into a **single deployed web application**:
**[Unified-AI-Driven-GIS-Based-Analytics-Platform](#)**

This platform is designed as a **decision-support and research tool** for:

* Urban developers
* Policymakers
* Researchers
* Civic authorities

to enable **sustainable, evidence-driven decision-making** in areas like crime monitoring, pollution tracking, biodiversity mapping, infrastructure development, and urban growth planning.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗺️ Interactive Mapping

* Built on **Leaflet.js** for seamless, dynamic maps.
* Supports pan, zoom, and multiple base layers (urban, vegetation, transport, satellite).
* Define custom **Analysis Radius** for region-specific insights.

---

### 🤖 AI-Powered Land Cover Analysis

* Upload custom **satellite images** or select an area directly on the map.
* Uses a **U-Net semantic segmentation model** for land cover classification.
* Detects: **Buildings, Vegetation, Water Bodies, Infrastructure**.
* Produces:

  * Side-by-side image comparisons
  * Percentage breakdowns of land cover categories

---

### 📊 AI-Generated Sustainability Reports

* Automatically generates **region-specific sustainability reports**.

* Metrics include:

  * **Sustainability Index (0–100)**
  * Building density
  * Vegetation-to-concrete ratio
  * Infrastructure growth potential

* Provides **expert-style recommendations** for sustainable development.

---

### 🔍 On-Demand GIS Insights with RAG

* Integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for **context-aware insights**.
* Connects AI models with external **GIS datasets, crime statistics, and environmental reports**.
* Prevents hallucination by grounding LLM outputs in **real datasets**.

📌 Generates context-driven reports on:

* **Safety & Crime Hotspots**
* **Pollution & Environmental Stress**
* **Tourism & Accessibility Factors**
* **Infrastructure Bottlenecks & Urban Risk**

---

### 🌐 Integrated Risk Maps

* Unified **risk visualization layers** (crime, biodiversity, transport, vegetation, water).
* Pulls data from **ArcGIS APIs + locally hosted datasets**.
* Heatmaps and categorical overlays help visualize **risk zones**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
* **Mapping:** Leaflet.js
* **AI/ML Models:**

  * **U-Net Segmentation** → Land Cover Classification
  * **RAG-based NLP** → Contextual GIS Insights
* **Backend:** REST APIs (Python/FastAPI)
* **Data Handling:** JSON, GIS Layers, External APIs
* **Visualization:** Charts, Heatmaps, Risk Maps

---

## 🔬 AI/ML Integration

### 🛰️ U-Net Segmentation

* Trained on satellite & urban imagery.
* Classifies **Buildings, Vegetation, Water** with pixel-level accuracy.
* Applications: **Land-use planning, deforestation monitoring, urban expansion detection**.

---

### 📚 RAG-Based Contextual Analysis

* **Vector Store + LLM Integration** for domain-aware GIS queries.

* Pipeline:

  1. Query entered by user
  2. Relevant GIS datasets / reports retrieved
  3. Summarization + contextualization by LLM
  4. Output: Reliable, data-grounded insights

* Example Queries:

  * *“Show me biodiversity risk in the last 5 years for this region.”*
  * *“What are the top crime hotspots within 5 km radius?”*
  * *“Suggest sustainable land-use planning for high-traffic zones.”*

---

## 🌟 Use Cases

* **Urban Planning** → Road networks, housing layouts, transport routes.
* **Environmental Monitoring** → Track deforestation, biodiversity decline, air/water pollution.
* **Risk Management** → Identify flood zones, high-crime areas, or pollution clusters.
* **Policy & Governance** → Evidence-based civic development planning.
* **Tourism & Accessibility** → Safe and eco-friendly travel routes.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* 🔄 Real-time IoT sensor data integration (air quality, traffic, weather).
* 📈 Time-series GIS change detection with temporal layers.
* 🗺️ 3D GIS visualization (buildings, terrain models).
* 🤖 Transformer-based **vision-language models** for smarter geospatial reasoning.
* ☁️ Cloud-based deployment for large-scale, multi-user collaboration.
