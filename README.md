# 🌍 AI-Driven GIS Analytics Platform

A unified **AI-powered Geographic Information System (GIS) platform** for analyzing, tracking, and visualizing urban and environmental data. It combines interactive mapping with AI-driven analytics (powered by **U-Net segmentation** and **RAG-based contextual models**) to deliver deep insights into **crime, pollution, biodiversity, infrastructure, sustainability, and urban growth**.

It is designed as a **research and planning tool** for urban developers, policymakers, researchers, and civic authorities to make **data-driven, sustainable decisions**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗺️ Interactive Mapping

* Dynamic maps built with **Leaflet.js**.
* Pan, zoom, and toggle between multiple base layers (urban, vegetation, transport).
* Define an **Analysis Radius** for focused study.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Land Cover Analysis

* Upload satellite images or select areas directly from the map.
* Uses **U-Net deep learning model** for semantic segmentation.
* Detects land covers like Buildings, Vegetation, Water, and Infrastructure.
* Provides side-by-side comparison + percentage breakdowns.

### 📊 AI-Generated Sustainability Reports

* Region-wise reports generated automatically.
* Includes a **Sustainability Index (0–100)**, building density, vegetation ratio, and infrastructure growth potential.
* Delivers expert-style recommendations for **sustainable development**.

### 🔍 On-Demand GIS Insights with RAG

* Integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** for context-aware insights.
* Pulls relevant GIS datasets, risk data, and environmental reports.
* Generates precise summaries on:

  * **Safety & Crime Hotspots**
  * **Pollution & Environmental Stress**
  * **Tourism & Accessibility**
  * **Infrastructure Bottlenecks**

### 🌐 Integrated Risk Maps

* Risk visualizations for crime, biodiversity, transport, vegetation, and water.
* Combines **ArcGIS datasets** with **locally hosted layers**.

## 🔬 AI/ML Integration

* **U-Net Segmentation:**

  * For land cover classification (Buildings, Vegetation, Water).
  * Useful in land use planning, deforestation detection, and urban growth tracking.

* **RAG-Based Contextual Analysis:**

  * Combines vector search + LLMs for domain-specific queries.
  * Fetches relevant documents, crime datasets, pollution indices, and GIS layers.
  * Produces **reliable, grounded insights** rather than hallucinations.

---

## 🌟 Use Cases

* **Urban Planning**: Road, housing, and transport design.
* **Environmental Monitoring**: Deforestation, biodiversity decline, pollution spread.
* **Risk Management**: Identifying high-risk zones for crime, floods, or pollution.
* **Policy & Governance**: Evidence-backed planning.
* **Tourism & Accessibility**: Mapping safe and sustainable routes.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Real-time IoT sensor data fusion (pollution, weather, traffic).
* Time-series GIS change detection.
* 3D GIS visualization support.
* Transformer-based vision models for more precise mapping.
